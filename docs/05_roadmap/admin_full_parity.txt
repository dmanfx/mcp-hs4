Admin Enhancements Backlog (Post-v1.0.0)

Current State (Already Implemented)

1. User administration
- list, create, update, delete, and set role (`hs4.admin.users.*`)

2. Plugin lifecycle
- catalog read, install, update, remove, enable/disable, restart (`hs4.admin.plugins.*`)

3. Interface management
- list, add, update, remove, restart, diagnostics (`hs4.admin.interfaces.*`)

4. System administration
- backup start, restore start, service restart, shutdown, config get/set (`hs4.admin.system.*`)

5. Camera administration
- config list/create/update/delete, stream profile set, recording set (`hs4.admin.cameras.*`)

6. Event administration
- create, update, delete (`hs4.admin.events.*`)

7. Config and metadata administration
- device metadata set, categories list/upsert/delete (`hs4.admin.config.*`)

8. Admin safety and routing controls
- explicit admin guard envelope (`operationTier`, `domain`, `maintenanceWindowId`, `changeTicket`, `riskLevel`)
- domain-level enable flags and global admin gate
- execution routing modes (`adapter`, `direct`, `auto`) with fallback and capability cache
- audit/state resources (`hs4://admin/policy/state`, `hs4://admin/audit/diff`)

Remaining Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented or Not Fully Generalized)

1. User/session/auth policy depth
- session lifecycle controls and richer auth-policy operations when exposed by HS4

2. Interface lifecycle depth
- interface backup/restore workflows and firmware-specific operations where HS4/API surface permits

3. System configuration breadth
- broader time/network/system policy operations if reliable HS4 endpoints are available

4. Event graph tooling depth
- higher-level trigger/action/condition graph authoring helpers beyond raw definition payload edits

5. Admin resilience validation depth
- expanded long-running interruption/chaos testing
- formalized backup/restore disaster rehearsal automation

Roadmap Rules

- No admin endpoint should be considered production-ready without:
- typed input/output contract
- policy enforcement tests
- audit coverage tests
- rollback path notes

- Admin tools remain disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled in configuration.
